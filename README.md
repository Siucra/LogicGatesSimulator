A small simulator project created in Eclipse using Java. It uses GUI elements, images and Boolean logic to display and simulate how logic gates work.
The user can choose a gate from a dropdown menu. The simulator shows the gate before and after evaluation and displays a true or false output based on one or more inputs.

To run this program, simply download both LogicGateGUI.java and LogicGateApp.java (and all respected files) and use Eclipse (Or your preferred IDE) and run the LogicGateApp.java file.
